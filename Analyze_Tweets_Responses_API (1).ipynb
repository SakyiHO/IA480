    "It covers essential techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Connecting to a MongoDB database** to store and retrieve tweets.\n",
    "- **Extracting tweets** and converting them into a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "- **Creating a vector store** and uploading tweets for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Using file search** to analyze private datasets.\n",
    "- **Performing web search** to retrieve the latest public information.\n",
    "- **Utilizing stateful responses** to maintain conversation context.\n",
    "- **Combining file and web search** to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, users will be able to integrate OpenAI's Responses API for efficient data retrieval \n",
    "and analysis of structured and unstructured data."

    "### Introduction to Web Search\n",
    "The OpenAI Web Search tool allows models to retrieve real-time information from the internet. \n",
    "This capability is particularly useful for obtaining up-to-date data, fact-checking, and expanding knowledge \n",
    "without relying solely on pre-trained information. \n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging OpenAI's web search functionality, the Responses API can fetch external data \n",
    "and provide accurate, relevant results in real time (OpenAI, 2025). \n",
    "This feature enhances applications that require the latest insights, such as news aggregation, research, \n",
    "or dynamic content generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, visit the official OpenAI documentation: \n",
